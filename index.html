    <h1>how to cook a pizza w/ pineapple</h1>
    <h3>to cook a pineapple pizza, you must first buy the following ingrediants from wal-mart or your local subway:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>pined apples (get them ripe or it'll be nasty and soggy like if you dip a sock in water and chew on it)</li>
        <li>pizza (frozen pizza is objectively nasty, go get it from costco or something) (costco best store)</li>
        <li>tears of pineapple haters in a jar (you will drink every last drop of salty eye-water)</li>
     </ul>
    <h3>excellent, now that you have gathered each item on your own accord, you must now cook this masterpiece to absolute perfection. save the tears until you complete your artwork.</h3>
    <h3>here is each step to create this pineapple pizza:</h3>
   <ol>
   <li>grab your pizza and heat it in the microwave. if you do not have a functioning microwave, that sucks. we need this pizza to be extra hot like the burning souls of the haters of pineapple pizza. the microwave must be on for 5 minutes, the amount of generations it took for there to be a region located in north america, because the origin of pineapple on pizza stems from canada. o canada, o canadaaaaaaaaaaaa</li><br>
   <li>take the pizza out of the microwave and sing stereotypical italian music. you must use this music to gain the blessing of our italian overlords to have permission to create such a magnificent delight that no italian could ever imagine</li><br>
     <li>take your pineapple and cut it with a huge knife (the size of the vatican), unless you bought sliced pineapple in one of those containers like at target or walmart or something. if you did buy it like that, IT WILL EXPIRE IN LIKE A DAY, HURRY UP AND COOK AND EAT THE PINEAPPLE PIZZA BEFORE IT BECOMES NASTY!!!!</li><br>
     <li>place the pineapple gently onto the pizza. GENTLY OR IT WILL ACT UP LIKE HOW THE COMPUTERS WOULDN'T LOAD AMPLIFY IN ELA THAT ONE DAY. C'MON, DON'T GO TOO SLOW OR THE PIZZA WILL FORCIBLY TAKE THE PINEAPPLE FROM YOU AND THROW IT INTO THE NEAREST TRASH CAN. make sure you have a trash can or your pineapple will disappear! if it is thrown into the trash can, scoop it out. SCOOP IT OUT. I DON'T CARE IF IT TASTES LIKE DUST. IT WILL STILL TASTE GOOD, I SWEAR!</li><br>
     <li>take the jar of tears and place it next to your box of pizza. gulp down the entire, FULL jar until like i informed before, THE VERY LAST DROP. ALL OF THEM MUST BE CONSUMED. I DON'T CARE IF YOU NEED TO THROW UP OR DRINK ACTUAL WATER, DO NOT STOP. CHUG IT ALL. GET THE HICCUPS FOR ALL I CARE.</li><br>
     <li>once you have completed each step before, congrats! pray to the pineapple gods and then, you may now devour the pineapple pizza!</li>
